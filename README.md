# URLShortenerAPI
A small API for shortening URL's provided by Users.

## API Endpoints

1. get / - Provies a very basic HTML page for inserting the URL to be shortened and the email address. 
2. post /getshorturl- Makes a post request with the email and the URL. Checks if its valid or not. If both are valid then it generates a random number which acts as the shortened URL. 
Returns a string with the new shortened URL. 
3. get /getshorturl/:id- redirects to the URL which was provided beforehand. 

## How?
Simply takes in the big URL and maps it with a random number generated. Makes a second URL with the random number and a GET request to that URL redirects the user to the original webpage. 

This is probably vulnerable. It is not very well thought out.
